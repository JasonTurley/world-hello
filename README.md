# world-hello

## What is this?

A twist on the classic "hello world" program - this is a playground for implemeting
over-the-top programs that eventually print "world hello".

## Motivation
Years ago, I found a StackOverflow post where someone asked how to write a "Hello,
World" program. Since this is one of the easiest, beginner-friendly programs in
existance, the replies were a bit trolly. 

The replies were filled with dozens of overcomplicated hello world programs. I search
but could not find this post anywhere. 

## TODO
- Add server.c to process client
- Rewrite and proof read this file
